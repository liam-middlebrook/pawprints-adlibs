They have prohibited organizations like Texas EquuSearch, a non-profit organization from utilizing these small unmanned surveillance aircraft which are vital to finding and perhaps saving the lives of lost persons.  By prohibiting the use of these vehicles, the FAA may in fact be directly responsible for the loss of human life, which is a direct contradiction to its purpose.  I urge the president and the administration to investigate the motives of the FAA and instruct them to change whatever polices that are in place and allow non-commercial search and rescue organizations to use these types of small aircraft.","issues":[{"id":"10","name":"Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement"},{"id":"127","name":"Regulatory Reform"},{"id":"169","name":"Transportation and Infrastructure"}],"signatureThreshold":100000,"signatureCount":567,"signaturesNeeded":99433,"url":"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-instruct-dot-and-faa-allow-non-commercial-use-uavs-search-and-rescue-operations/smZw2h9w","deadline":1402034548,"status":"open","response":null,"created":1399442548},{"id":"5369382a2bcfa3e263000000","type":"petition","title":"EXTEND THE UNEMPLOYMENT BILL!","body":"Respectfully asking President Obama to pass the unemployment extension- millions of Americans need it urgently!

People living with uncontrolled seizures have reported beneficial effects and reduced seizure activity when using medical marijuana. A lack of research is a major concern for public health and patient safety, consistent dosage, and potential side effects.  However, the hope provided for some is highly sought by families in need.  Unfortunately, because marijuana-based products including the non-psychoactive cannabidiol are Schedule I drugs, it is very difficult for researchers to perform needed studies.  We urge the Obama administration to ask DEA to reschedule marijuana products so researchers can study the benefits and side effects of this treatment option that could potentially help millions of people living with epilepsy.","issues":[{"id":"13","name":"Disabilities"},{"id":"25","name":"Health Care"},{"id":"127","name":"Regulatory Reform"}],"signatureThreshold":100000,"signatureCount":10565,"signaturesNeeded":89435,"url":"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ask-dea-reschedule-marijuana-lower-level-benefit-greater-access-research-purposes/vJVF409k","deadline":1397943881,"status":"closed","response":null,"created":1395351881},{"id":"532b3954704301054b00001d","type":"petition","title":"Impeach Speaker of the House John Boehner to compensate for the costs of EU benefits.","body":"In the last week Speaker of the House Boehner has verbally made it clear that he has no intentions of extending unemployment benefits when he claimed the work load would be to much.

ALD usually manifests in boys between the ages of 4 x 10.  The disease progresses silently and is often not diagnosed until symptoms begin. Once diagnosed due to physical symptoms it is too late for treatment. Early diagnosis is the KEY to treatment. New York is currently the only state testing for ALD.
